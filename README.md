To make it earier to develop I use the following VS Code plugins:
* Prettier - Code formatter
* Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
* There are also database plugins to manage the DB (like the azure databases) but I have not install it 

I also make sure that autosave is enabled
* settings > search for autosave > from the dropdown select onFocusChage
